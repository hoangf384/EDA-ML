# Data Projects Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Projects Portfolio!
This repository is a curated collection of projects I completed during my learning journey in data analytics and machine learning. Each project showcases my growing expertise in **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **data preprocessing**, and the application of **basic machine learning models** for prediction and classification tasks.

##  What You'll Find Here

Most of the files in this repo reflect hands-on experiments with real-world datasets using Python, pandas, and scikit-learn. The focus was not just on building models, but on **understanding the data**, identifying insights, and telling meaningful stories through visualization and metrics.

Each project typically includes:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Visualization using matplotlib / seaborn / plotly
* Light Machine Learning modeling (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
* Evaluation using metrics like MAE, RMSE, accuracy

## Purpose

These projects were completed as part of coursework, online exercises, or self-study sessions.
They demonstrate my ability to:

* Explore complex datasets and extract meaningful patterns
* Communicate insights through clear visualizations
* Apply appropriate machine learning techniques to solve business and analytical problems

## Tech Stack

* **Languages**: Python
* **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, plotly
* **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab


Each folder includes a notebook and (where applicable) a short summary of the dataset, questions explored, techniques used, and results obtained.

## Ongoing Learning

I'm continuously expanding my skill set, diving deeper into:

* Feature engineering
* Model optimization
* Advanced machine learning techniques
* Real-world data storytelling
